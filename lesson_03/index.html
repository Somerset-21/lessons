			<p>Ukrainian folk oral literature, poetry, and songs (such as the dumas) are among the most disctinctive ethnocultural
			features of Ukrainians as a people. The particularly vital role of folklore in the formation of modern Ukrainian culture
			and national consciousness was the result of an unusually important role that peasantry played in the history of
			Ukraine. Not only did peasants make up the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainian population until the 1930s, but they
			also contributed much to the preservation and development of the Ukrainian language and traditional way of life. Their
			conservative attitude toward traditions, language, and faith--in short, their fostering of national and ethnic
			characteristics, some of which extend back to pre-Christian times and even to Indo-European roots--was of great
			importance for the Ukrainian nation, which had been subdued by powerful neighbors and, particularly in the case of the
			upper classes and the urban strata, exposed to assimilatory influences. In the 19th century, folk songs and folk oral
			literature not only served as the basis for the reconstruction of the Ukrainian literary language, but also provided
			Ukrainian writers, composers, and intellectuals with the components for the creation of a modern national culture...</p>

					<p><span class="decor-upper">FOLKLORE.</span> In Ukrainian folklore scholarship there is an overwhelming tendency to equate folklore with folk oral
					literature. In this discipline folk tales (tales of magic, animal tales, legends, anecdotes, etc), folk songs (ritual
					songs and non-ritual songs), and items of the minor verbal genres (proverbs and riddles) are collected and studied. Some
					of the above (animal tales, some songs and games, and certain types of proverbs and riddles) are children's folklore.
					Oral literature consists of variant texts whose authorship is unknown, the texts being passed along by word of mouth and
					in the process changed to some degree by each performer. Pre-Christian Ukrainian folk customs and rites were described
					in Arabic and Byzantine sources. Other documentation of Ukrainian folklore is found in the earliest of literary
					monuments in Ukraine (ie, the chronicles and Slovo o polku Ihorevi), where instances of folk prose, proverbs, and ritual
					songs can be found. Christianity introduced into Ukraine not only dogma but also apocryphal and classical folklore
					traditions...</p>

					<p><span class="decor-upper">FOLK ORAL LITERATURE.</span> The sum of oral works, both poetry and prose, which are produced usually by anonymous authors and
					are preserved in the people's memory for a long time by being passed on orally from generation to generation. Ukrainian
					folk oral literature has its distinctive artistic qualities, its unique poetic devices--metaphors, similes, epithets,
					and symbolism. The poetic folk literature consists mostly of folk songs, which are subdivided into various genres:
					ritual songs (songs associated with spring rituals, including vesnianky-hahilky, carols, Kupalo festival songs, harvest
					songs, wedding songs and funeral songs), historical songs and dumas, lyrical songs and dance songs. Folk prose can be
					divided into fables, fairy tales, stories, legends, and anecdotes. Poetic-prose folk literature consists of spells,
					proverbs, sayings, and riddles. In the 19th century the works of folk oral literature were held to be the products of a
					collective popular mind. Contemporary folklorists favor the theory that individuals are the creators of the oral
					tradition...</p>

					<p><span class="decor-upper">FOLK SONGS.</span> The song is one of the oldest and most prevalent forms of folklore. It unites a poetic text with a melody.
					Songs usually have a well-defined strophic structure: all stanzas are set to the same melody as the first stanza. Each
					stanza is often followed by a refrain. Folk songs are usually monodic choral songs, but Ukrainian folk songs are
					exceptional for their rich polyphony. The folk songs express the common experience of the Ukrainian people: all the
					important events in life from the cradle to the grave are accompanied by song. By their content and function folk songs
					can be divided into four basic groups: (1) ritual songs, such as carols (koliadky and shchedrivky), spring songs, songs
					about nymphs, and Kupalo festival songs; (2) harvest songs and wedding songs; (3) historical songs and political songs,
					such as dumas and ballads; and (4) lyrical songs, such as family songs, social class songs, and love songs. Chumak
					songs, recruits' and soldiers' songs, wanderers' songs, and cradle songs belong to separate groups...</p>

					<p><span class="decor-upper">HISTORICAL SONGS.</span> A genre of folk songs that presents historical events and individuals in a generalized, artistic
					manner with details, names, and facts that may be inaccurate. Ukrainian historical songs appeared at the same time as
					the dumas, and perhaps even preceded them. They differ from the dumas in that they describe concrete historical events
					and figures; their story line is less developed, their emotive range is greater, and in them the lyrical element
					prevails over the epic element. The oldest cycle of historical songs dates back to the 16th century and depicts the
					Cossacks' struggle against the Tatars and Turks; the best known are the songs about Baida Vyshnevetsky of 1564 and the
					siege of the Pochaiv Monastery of 1675. A second cycle consists of songs about the Cossacks' struggle against Poland. A
					third cycle deals with Russian oppression and includes songs about construction work on the Saint Petersburg canals, the
					destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, and the death of a Cossack in Russian captivity...</p>

					<p><span style="color: rgb(81, 139, 0);" class="decor-upper">RITUAL SONGS (obriadovi pisni).</span> Folk songs that accompanied important changes in a person's life and the seasonal cycles
					in farming. Calendric ritual folk songs include carols or koliadky and shchedrivky (on Christmas and Epiphany),
					Shrovetide songs, vesnianky-hahilky and ryndzivky (on Easter), tsarynni and rusalka songs (on the Rosalia), Saint
					Peter's day songs, haymowers' and rakers' songs, Kupalo festival songs, harvest songs, vechernytsi songs, and songs to
					Saint Nicholas. The ritual songs of family life include christening songs, wedding songs, and funeral hymns and laments.
					At one time ritual songs were believed to possess magical powers: they could ensure a bountiful harvest and the
					well-being of the persons mentioned in them. Eventually they lost their magical meaning and were regarded simply as
					entertaining or expressive. All ritual songs contain some ancient pagan elements mixed with more recent, mostly
					Christian, elements. The majority of them are tied to ritual acts, games, dances, and folk customs...</p>
